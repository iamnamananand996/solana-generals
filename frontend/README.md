# MagicBlock Boilerplate

## Introduction

This folder contains an example of a fully functioning on-chain game using MagicBlock's engine.

## Using the code

The `src` folder contains a basic example app to get started.

* Run `npm install` to install dependencies.
* Run one of the following commands:
    1. `npm run build-dev` to build the app in `development` mode.
    2. `npm run build-prod` to build in `production` mode. Note that the prod build extracts the transpiled CSS into `dist/main.css` using `mini-css-extract-plugin`, whereas the dev build bundles it into the JS file.
    3. `npm run dev` to start the dev-server.
* Make whatever additional changes you need for your project.
